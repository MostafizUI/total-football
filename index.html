                  It’s time for the 2021 Copa America Final! After a tournament full of intense, emotional matches we have arrived at the last game, and it is the one we have all been waiting for.

                  Both of these teams cruised through the group stage and had tough knockout games to get here, and they’re pretty evenly matched right now.

                  Lionel Messi starts and captains the Albiceleste, and Neymar headlines the Brazilian team. This will be so, so good. Vamos!
